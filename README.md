# Interactive-Sales-Dashboard
Developed an interactive sales performance dashboard to analyze total revenue, average sales, units sold, and profit across products, regions, and channels. Designed slicers for region, product category, and sales channel to enable dynamic filtering. Built insights such as:

• Identified top-performing products using total sales and unit-sold visualizations.
• Compared online vs offline channel contribution, highlighting major revenue drivers.
• Analyzed regional sales distribution using donut charts to reveal strongest markets (Asia, Europe, North America).
• Highlighted product segments like Office Supplies, Cosmetics, and Baby Food as key contributors to total revenue.
• Designed visually appealing KPI cards and charts for management decision-making.
• Ensured clean layout, consistent formatting, and user-friendly interactions.
